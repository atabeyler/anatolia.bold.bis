# Security Architecture

This document describes security-relevant design decisions. See
`SECURITY.md` for the current implementation status and vulnerability
reporting.

## Design principles

- **Candidates, not verdicts**: the biometric engine returns ranked,
  scored candidates for human review. A "Confirmed Identity" status is
  only ever set by an explicit human verification action — never derived
  automatically from a similarity score.
- **Least privilege**: RBAC with five roles — `SYSTEM_ADMIN`,
  `SECURITY_ADMIN`, `OPERATOR`, `REVIEWER`, `AUDITOR`. `OPERATOR` (and
  `REVIEWER`/`SECURITY_ADMIN`/`SYSTEM_ADMIN`) may create searches;
  confirming/rejecting a candidate is restricted to `REVIEWER`,
  `SECURITY_ADMIN`, and `SYSTEM_ADMIN`; `SYSTEM_ADMIN`/`SECURITY_ADMIN`
  handle system configuration and user administration. `AUDITOR` can view
  search/candidate data but cannot create searches or review candidates.
  A newly approved registration is granted `OPERATOR` by default — the
  least-privileged authenticated role — and must be explicitly promoted
  by an admin.

## Implemented today

- Baseline security response headers on every response (see
  `SECURITY.md`).
- CORS restricted to an explicit origin allow-list; credentialed
  (cookie-carrying) requests require an explicit origin and header list —
  never a wildcard.
- Per-request IDs for traceability without logging sensitive payloads.
- A single stable error shape (`ApiError`) — no stack traces or internal
  detail ever reaches the client.
- JWT authentication (15-minute access token in the response body,
  30-day refresh token as an `HttpOnly` cookie), bcrypt password hashing,
  RBAC role enforcement on admin and search/candidate routes, per-key
  rate limiting on login/registration/admin-seed, and an admin-approval
  gate on every new registration.
- Refresh-cookie `SameSite` selection: `Strict` outside production;
  in production, `Lax` for same-origin requests and `None` (with
  `Secure`) only for the one legitimate cross-origin case (a
  desktop/mobile client's local bridge calling the cloud API) — never a
  blanket `None`.

## Not yet implemented

MFA, enterprise SSO, and upload validation (MIME/size/dimension/corruption
checks) are planned (see `docs/ROADMAP.md`) but not present in the
codebase yet. Do not assume any of them are active.
